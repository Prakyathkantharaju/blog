## what are variables ?
Variables are the one of most important thing about any programming language. They are the place where any value is stored.
They not just store the data like, integer or float or string they can also be used to store other variable.
In python assigning a varible is through `=` operator.


### Primitive dataype
Here are some example of assign the numerical value
```
a = 1
b = 2.0
c = None
d = 'data'
```
Here in the `a,b,c,d` are the variables which are on the left side of the `=` operator
and the value on the right side in the value assigned to the variable.
In this example, `a` is the `int` dataype, `b` is the `float` datatype, `c` is the `Nonetype` and
`d` is the string (`str`) type. These data types are called primitive datatypes forms the basis of everything.


You can also assign the variable to another variable
```
a = b
```
